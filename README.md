# Timer Turtle

Just a simple app to track timers, one at a time. Great idea Dan.

This is just a vanilla react app with `react-bootstrap`. To build yourself, just 
clone and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. If you'd like to fork and deploy
to your own github page, just update the `homepage` key in `package.json` with your 
github repo url and run `npm run deploy` to deploy it.
